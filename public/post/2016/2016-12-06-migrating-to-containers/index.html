                    <p>The time has come to move off my statically hosted ubuntu box on Digital Ocean and on to a more modern and containerized stack.</p>

<p><em>Why?</em></p>

<p>My Digital Ocean box was 32-bit Ubuntu, and I had not done much in terms of maintaining it in a while. I considered upgrading it, but the configuration was a <em>work of art</em> and my work with CoreOS and containers in my dayjob inspired me to move to something more modern. I didn&rsquo;t want to go the Ansible plus static infrastructure route, since I have been migrating clients off that for a few years now. I wanted to run a few other applications in containers as well so I thought this would be a good starting point. I have done this type of work frequently for entire enterprises, so this was the obvious choice. I&rsquo;m documenting it because it was a fun exercise and others might benefit from it. Here is the existing infrastructure and pipeline:</p>

<p>Github -&gt; Codeship Pipeline to hugo build, smoke test, then rsync artifacts -&gt; Digital Ocean box with NGINX and Let&rsquo;s Encrypt SSL</p>

<p>Simple setup. I didn&rsquo;t really like the rsync in the pipeline, or NGINX being non-configuration managed, but it worked and was comfortable.</p>

<p>Here is the desired state:</p>

<p>Github push -&gt; something Hugo build -&gt; something Container packaging -&gt; Ship to containerized host -&gt; Decomission previous nginx container.</p>

<p>I also wanted to put let&rsquo;s encrypt into its own container for bonus points, and so that I could run the same artifact locally and remotely.</p>

<p>I got started by doing a basic local nginx container that mounted my generated hugo source by mounting it. This is for my quick iterative development workflow.</p>

<pre><code>  #!/bin/bash
  hugo --cleanDestinationDir --baseURL http://localhost/
  chmod -R 777 public
  docker stop iflowfor8hours-nginx-sidecar
  docker rm -f iflowfor8hours-nginx-sidecar
  docker run --name iflowfor8hours-nginx-sidecar -v &quot;$PWD&quot;/public:/usr/share/nginx/html -v &quot;$PWD&quot;/dev/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro -p 80:80 nginx:alpine
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>chmod -R 777</code> is ugly, but I&rsquo;m not concerned with anything getting broken since this is generated code and only used locally.</p>

<p>The next phase involved creating the container that I would use in production. I didn&rsquo;t want to bake the let&rsquo;s encrypt stuff into the container because I felt that it violated the concept of small, single purpose containers. I wrote a minimal <code>Dockerfile</code> first and built it by hand.</p>

<pre><code>FROM nginx:alpine
COPY public /usr/share/nginx/html
RUN chown -R nginx:nginx /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY dev/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m using nginx:alpine because I was considering using <a href="https://hyper.sh">hyper.sh</a> to host my containers, and still might. I wanted to keep it as small as possible since this is only going to be serving static html. This was another reason for the added complexity cost of putting let&rsquo;s encrypt in another container.</p>

<p>I then wrote the script for building the content and the container. I figured I might as well do this now, as the CI system will need some kind of entrypoint. This also helped me iterate quickly on my local box.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# Create a production and non-prod BASEURL environment variable in pipeline configuration

if [ -z &quot;${BASEURL}&quot; ]; then 
    HUGO_BASEURL='http://localhost/'
else 
    HUGO_BASEURL=${BASEURL}
fi

env HUGO_BASEURL=${HUGO_BASEURL} hugo --cleanDestinationDir
docker build -t iflowfor8hours:blog .
echo docker run --name bakedblog -p 80:80 iflowfor8hours:blog
</code></pre>

<p>I played with that for a bit, and everything works as expected. Now I need to get lets encrypt working. Since certs are free and I already own my domain, I can afford to have an https enabled staging environment. I now needed to decide on a docker hosting environment and platform. The easiest way to get up and running with containerized infrastructure is CoreOS, hands down. I spun up a coreos box on DO and then reconfigured my DNS to point it at.</p>

<p>The next phase will be to setup the pipeline and finally deploy my containers to the newly provisioned container host.</p>

<p>I also plan on migrating to IPv6 when the hosts are setup properly.</p>
