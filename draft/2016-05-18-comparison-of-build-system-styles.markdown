coupled-ness
  How coupled am I to understanding the rest of the ecosystem around this tool or practice

  -1: Upon first staring into the abyss, one realizes that training people to get certified on this makes more sense and is probably more lucrative than using it. (AWS, Jenkins, Chef, Agile, DVORAK layout, OpenStack)
   0: A considerable level of investment is needed to derive any value, getting it working is a pain, and it blocks progress if I choose to ignore it. (Bundler, virtualenv, Makefiles)
   1: Some would notice if it were added, but as it's responsiblity is clearly defined, I can ignore it if someone else configures and maintains it. (SSL, consul)
   2: Upon usage, no one notices or cares except for the value I instantly deliver. If I don't want to use it, I don't have to think about it and never will. (nevergreen, pingdom)

vendor-ness

price-trickiness

expertise-fluffing (in the porn sense)
