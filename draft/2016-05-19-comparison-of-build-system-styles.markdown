Why don't you have a PaaS?
At many clients I have seen the desire to speed up delivery come against the harsh reality of running your own PaaS. A well-architected PaaS greatly simplifies deployment and development by standardizing many of the complexities 
A PaaS is often the solution to many deployment and development challenges.

Do not think your development or deployment process is sacred, challenge that belief to enable DevOps.
